    "The objective of this project is to examine the relationship between weather conditions and train disruptions in the Netherlands. Railway disruption records are combined with meteorological data to quantify the extent to which factors such as precipitation, wind, and temperature are associated with delays and service interruptions. The analysis aims to establish whether specific weather conditions systematically affect railway performance and to what degree.\n",

    "#### *To what extent do weather conditions influence train disruptions in the Netherlands?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub-questions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are disruptions more frequent on days with adverse weather compared to days with mild weather?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do disruption durations increase under heavy precipitation, strong wind, or temperature extremes?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which weather variable shows the strongest association with disruption frequency?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are there seasonal differences in how weather affects train disruptions?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are there regional variations in the relationship between weather and disruptions?*"

    "Two primary datasets are available for this study. The first dataset, disruptions-2024(2).csv, contains records of train disruptions in the Netherlands during 2024. Each record provides details on the type of disruption, its duration, and the time of occurrence. This dataset represents the dependent variable, as it directly reflects railway system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset, vorigemaand.txt, is derived from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and provides weather observations for the same period. It includes variables such as precipitation intensity, temperature, and wind speed. These variables serve as independent factors to explain variation in railway disruptions."
